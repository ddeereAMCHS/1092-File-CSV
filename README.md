# File CSV

- Create a program called `FileCSV.java`
- Prompt the user for a filename
- The first line in the file describes the values in each line
  - It does not contain actual data
- Read in the rest of the lines in this file and store them in an array of Strings 
- For each element of that array, do the following:
  - Split the String on commas
  - Trim whitespace
  - For every person age 18 or older, print their name and the total wages earned that week
